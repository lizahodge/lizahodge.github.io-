				<p style="background-color: lightpink;"> My name is Elizabeth Hodge; I prefer to go by Liza. I am from Janesvillelle, Wisconsin originally and I am a Senior at the University of Wisconsin Madison. I plan to attend graduate school post-graduation for higher education and student administration, concentrating on student housing and life. I grew up on a farm, showed livestock my entire life, and was an active member in 4-H through high school. I am also an entrepreneur with my sister Maddie; we created a floral business where we grew, arranged, and delivered flowers. We successfully delivered arrangments to a multitude of weddings and graduation pirates over the summer months. In addition, we created social media and postcard mailing system. 

				I enjoy spending time with my family and friends and being active in my sorority. I am a cat person; I have an orange cat named Big Baby, the world's best cat. But I do love my three dogs named Charlie, Stella, and Clyde very much. My favorite colors are pink and orange, and I love to go swimming and snorkeling in the ocean! I also like to be creative anytime I can and get my craft on.

				I hope you enjoy my website and get to know me better!
